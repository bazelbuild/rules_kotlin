{"id":"rules_kotlin-77h","title":"Replace .release. files with tag-based filtering","description":"Replace 21 .release. files with a tag-based content filtering approach.\n\n## Current State\n- Files named `\u003cname\u003e.release.\u003cext\u003e` are renamed to `\u003cname\u003e.\u003cext\u003e` during release via packager.bzl\n- Separate files for dev vs release content\n\n## New Approach\n- Use `# RELEASE-CONTENT-START` / `# RELEASE-CONTENT-END` tags in single files\n- During release, keep ONLY content between tags, strip everything else\n- Merge .release.bzl implementations into main .bzl files\n\n## Key Changes\n1. Create content_filter.py tool in packager\n2. Merge 21 .release. files into their counterparts\n3. Update release_archive to filter instead of rename\n\nSee plan: ~/.claude/plans/async-gathering-knuth.md","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T16:04:36.543372309+01:00","created_by":"agluszak","updated_at":"2026-01-07T16:07:13.737277589+01:00"}
