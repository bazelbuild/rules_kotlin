    This test:
    1. Copies the test workspace excluding .new/.delete files
    2. Renames BUILD.bazel.txt to BUILD.bazel
    3. Runs initial Bazel build with IC logging enabled
    4. Applies modifications (copy .new files, delete .delete files)
    5. Runs incremental build
    6. Compares IC logs against expected build.log in the workspace

    The test workspace should contain:
    - MODULE.bazel or WORKSPACE file

    - build.log (expected IC output)
